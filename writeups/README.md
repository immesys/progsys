We will have one [Markdown]() file per paper, so we can read each others' comments easily.  Please paste your thoughts in with your name.

The goal of the writeups is to ensure you make time to read the papers in advance, but also to stir conversation and even potential research collaboration.  Two paragraphs will suffice:

1. One to summarize key things you learned from the paper
2. One to highlight open questions raised by the paper that you think are interesting.

Feel free to write more if you're inspired.

When possible, try to go beyond simply summarizing the paper, or poking obvious holes in it.  See if you can go a level deeper to find things we can *use*: what's intriguing or reusable about the paper, how can the paper's drawbacks inform a new effort?  If you're reading well, a good paper should inspire you to think up new stuff!  Please share it.
