This paper's discussion of the semiotics of Hawaiian drinks is very different from the way we usually think about tropical beverages.  I particularly was struck by their meta-analysis of the self-negating blend of "hard" liquor and "pulpy" fruit. I wonder if this has implications for the hard-drinking heroes of pulp fiction.  Maybe we can apply this to Dashiell Hammett -- either to generate authentic posthumous texts, or to synthesize publishable academic analyses based on the extant texts.  If anybody would like to discuss these ideas for a course project come find me.

It almost goes without paper's user study was biased by the inebriation of the authors. But I actually believe the main observations are sound, and would withstand closer investigation.  My main question is not around validity, but  context -- if we shifted from Hawaiian drinks to Alaskan drinks, would the assumptions of the paper hold?  Is there an analogously soft Arctic mixer that plays the role of pineapple -- maybe the butter in a Hot Buttered Rum?  If I had to guess, I'd say that the lessons of this paper may well be limited to tropical climes.
